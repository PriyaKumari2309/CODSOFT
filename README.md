#Description of simplecalculator.cpp file
The program takes an operator and two operands from the user.
The operator is stored in variable op and two operands are stored in num1 and num2 respectively.
Then, switch...case statement is used for checking the operator entered by user.
If user enters + then, statements for case: '+' is executed and program is terminated.
If user enters - then, statements for case: '-' is executed and program is terminated.
This program works similarly for the * and / operators. But, if the operator doesn't matches any of the four character [ +, -, * and / ], the default statement is executed which displays error message.

#Description of numberguessinggame.cpp file
1. srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(0))): This line initializes the random seed based on the current time. It ensures that the random number generated will be different each time the program is run.
2.int randomNumber = rand() % 100 + 1: This line generates a random number between 1 and 100. The rand() % 100 generates a number between 0 and 99, so adding 1 adjusts this range to 1 and 100.
3.do-while loop: The loop continues to prompt the user for a guess until they guess the correct number.
4.Feedback: Inside the loop, the program checks if the guess is too high, too low, or correct and provides appropriate feedback.
The program continuously prompts the user for their guess and provides hints until the correct number is guessed. When the correct number is guessed, it congratulates the user and exits.

#Description of tictactoe.cpp file
1.initializeBoard(): Initializes the game board with empty spaces.
2.displayBoard(): Displays the current state of the game board.
3.isBoardFull(): Checks if the board is full, indicating a draw if no more moves are possible.
4.checkWin(): Checks all possible winning conditions (rows, columns, and diagonals).
5.switchPlayer(): Switches the current player from 'X' to 'O' and vice versa.
6.makeMove(): Prompts the current player to enter their move, validates the input, and updates the board.
7.playGame(): Contains the main game loop that initializes the board, alternates turns, and checks for win or draw conditions.
8.askToPlayAgain(): Asks the players if they want to play another game.
9.main(): The entry point of the program, repeatedly calls playGame() and checks if players want to play again.
Compile and run this program in a C++ development environment or using a command-line tool with a command similar to:
